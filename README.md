Instructions

Include five total filters in the table:

Date
City
State
Country
Shape
To create these additional filters, keep the following points in mind:

You will need to create a new function that will replace your handleClick(); function. This function saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed.
Create an if-else statement to add filter data from input, or clear the filter if no input data exists.
Additionally, create a function named filterTable(); that will perform the following actions:
Set the filtered data to the table.
Loop through all of the filters and keep any data that matches the filter values.
Rebuild the table by calling the buildTable(); function created earlier.
Finally, using d3.selectAll();, attach an event listener to pick up changes that are made to each filter.
Below are links to starter code to help you build the additional filters. One of the files contains pseudocode, while the other is a blank slate. You can work with either file, though one provides an additional challenge.

Submission
Make sure your repo is up to date and includes the following:

A README.md file containing a short description of your project
The completed code saved in the proper folder structure. Hint: Make sure your JavaScript file is saved as app.js
A clean website with a functioning filter table
Submit the link to your repository through Canvas.
